	<div id = "info-wrapper">
		<p id = "info">The World Congress CS-IT Conferences began almost two decades ago as a way for those studying the computer sciences and information technology disciplines to collaborate with other professionals in the field. This conference is accessible to higher education students and working professionals wishing to network and present their academic findings. For a nominal fee, participants can submit their papers and possibly present to their peers in a 30,000 seat auditorium. History has shown a quick sell out of day passes so it is advisable that participants submit papers early and buy their admission tickets ASAP.<p>
